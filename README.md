## AI-Assisted Analysis of Renewable Energy Sector Trends
Overview:
You are tasked with developing a series of prompts that guide an AI through an
analysis of the renewable energy sector, focusing on recent advancements, policy
impacts, public sentiment, and future trends. Your goal is to produce a
comprehensive report that provides valuable insights into the sector.
Task Structure:
Initial Content Assessment:
● Design a prompt to extract key information from a collection of articles
related to renewable energy advancements. The aim is to identify major
themes such as technological innovations, policy changes, and market
trends.
In-depth Analysis:
● Create a prompt to conduct a detailed analysis of the identified themes,
assessing the implications of technological innovations, the
effectiveness of new policies, and the response of the market.
Sentiment and Public Opinion Evaluation:
● Develop a prompt to gauge public sentiment and opinion on renewable
energy advancements and policies, utilising sources such as social
media, forums, and surveys.
Synthesis and Report Generation:
● Conclude with a prompt that synthesises the gathered information and
insights into a structured report, highlighting key findings, emerging
trends, and providing recommendations for stakeholders.
Additional Instructions:
● Ensure each prompt is clear and directs the AI to focus on specific aspects of
the analysis, building logically on the information gathered from previous
steps.
● Consider the flow of information between prompts, ensuring that each step
provides the necessary input for subsequent analysis.
● Include considerations for the AI to critically evaluate sources and avoid bias
in its analysis.
Things to Look At:
● Clarity and specificity of prompts: Each prompt should clearly communicate
the task to the AI, ensuring focused and relevant responses.
● Logical progression: The sequence of prompts should follow a logical order,
with each step building on the insights gathered previously.
● Depth of analysis: Prompts should encourage the AI to not just summarise but
also analyse and interpret the information, providing deeper insights.
● Synthesis of information: The final prompt should bring together all the
insights in a coherent and structured report, demonstrating the AI's ability to
synthesise complex information.
Prompting Techniques to Consider (for reference after
completing the assignment):
● Zero-Shot Prompting: Generating responses without prior specific examples.
● Few-Shot Prompting: Using a limited number of examples to guide the AI's
response.
● Chain of Thought Prompting: Guiding the AI through a logical sequence of
thought processes.
● Self-Consistency Prompting: Ensuring the AI's responses are consistent with
previous outputs.
● Retrieval Augmented Generation: Leveraging external data sources to
enhance the AI's responses.
● Multimodal Prompting: Integrating various types of data (e.g., text, images) in
the prompting process.
This assignment focuses on the candidate's ability to design effective prompts that
guide the AI through a complex analytical process, without prescribing specific
prompting techniques. The inclusion of various techniques at the end serves as a
reference to broaden the candidate's understanding of different approaches to
prompt engineering.
